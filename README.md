# Elevate_labs_task_1
Short summary of what the "clean_data.py" does:
1. Missing director, cast, and country fields were filled with "Unknown".
2. Rows with missing key fields (date_added, rating) were removed.
3. Duplicate rows (if any) were eliminated.
4. Country and rating text standardized.
5. Dates converted to consistent format (datetime).
6. Column names normalized (lowercase, underscores).
7. Data types corrected (e.g., release_year as integer).
